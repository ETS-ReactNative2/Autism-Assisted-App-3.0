# About Application

Autism Assisted is developed by the Computer-Human Interaction and Social Experience Lab at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. We are committed to towards creating a medium for delivery of important, relevant and reliable information for individuals affected by ASD. Our vision for Autism Assisted sees it being the following

## Safe and reliable knowledge bank:

ASD, especially in third world countries, is poorly understood and a knowledge base must be created with the best information available from work done around the world. It is also important that this knowledge is made accessible to the largest possible group. We do this by creating information with several dimensions like web, mobile, print, video, languages and accessibility support to ensure we remove as many barriers to this knowledge as we can. Information is also verified by medical professionals with certification that provide key insights and reviews.

## Source of hope and togetherness:

ASD is a difficult thing to go through for individuals, caretakers and family members. It is a tough journey that we believe requires constant support from individuals going through the same struggles. This sense of community that centres around hope is key in creating strong support circles around ASD. "Autism Heroes" are parents, autistic individuals, caretakers, doctors and educators whose stories we believe need to be shared towards creating a more positive and hopeful outlook during the ASD journey.

## A platform for the future:

Autism Assisted is a source of information, community and resources that need to continually expand, update and be reviewed. As more time passes, we plan to keep adding more to Autism Assisted and hopefully contribute more in providing support for individuals affected not only by ASD but also other disorders.
