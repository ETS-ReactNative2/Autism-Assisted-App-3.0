Compulsions are repetitive behaviours that people with OCD engage in to combat these obsessions. A common example is an individual with OCD may be obsessed with the idea of cleanliness, fearing exaggerated dangerous consequences of not being clean. The compulsive behaviour they may engage in to calm their obsession may be showering an excessive number of times a day.\nRepetitive behaviours are a distinguishing sign of autism. The difference between autistic repetitive behaviours and the repetitive behaviours in OCD is that engaging in the repetitive behaviour that may or may not reduce anxiety in individuals with OCD. Autistic persons who do not have OCD are often not bothered by their repetitive behaviours.\nIt is important that the doctor you seek an OCD diagnosis from is familiar with autism. Medication and behavioural therapy can greatly reduce the symptoms of OCD.",
